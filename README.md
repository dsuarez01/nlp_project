Run the clustering_and_date_classification.ipynb (the initial data processing csv has already been made and saved in the zip). When mounting your drive, change the link to the path to this entire zip folder to your own local path. Additionally, in the coe block after that, change the path for songs_df to be ./data/year_limited_songs.csv.
